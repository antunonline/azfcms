# This document will try to define potential real world use cases that this language should be able

/**
* Example 1.
* In this example we will simply invoke method initialize() in no explicit namespace.
*/

initialize()



/** 
* Example 2.
* In this example we will call method login() with two arguments: login name and password.
* This method will return boolean response which will indicate status of login
*/

login("userName","password")


/**
* Example 3.
* In this example we will call isLoggedIn() method of user namespace. This
* method will return boolean value that will indicate login state of the user.
*/
user.isLoggedIn()

/**
* Example 4. 
* In this example we will call update method with associative array that has name key set
* to value "user" and id key set to value 33. The array will be used as first argument of the update method.
*/

update({name:"user",id:"33"})

/**
* Example 5. 
* In this example we will call delete method on article model. First argument of method
* will be integer that will uniquely identify the article. Returned value
* will return number of affected rows.
